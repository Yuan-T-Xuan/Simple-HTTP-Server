# Simple-HTTP-Server
This is a course project of Cornell CS 5450, Networked and Distributed Systems. It is a select()-based echo server with HTTP 1.1 parser and layer supporting GET, HEAD, and POST as defined in RFC 2616 and supports multiple concurrent clients.
## How to Run
Building and executing the echo code should be very simple:
- cd echo
- make
- ./echo_server
- ./echo_client localhost 8081
